#MD5 Canvas Fingerprinting Tool
##By Joseph Acevedo

A small, if somewhat useless tool to provide your server and end user with an MD5 hash for their images on a PHP server. It's been configured in it's current state to work on a pre-generated canvas, but I plan on editing it in the future to allow, among other things, for file uploads to be fingerprinted in the same fashion. There's no need for external libraries such as jQuery, so it should be plug and play.
